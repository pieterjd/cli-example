# CLI example
I'm a fan of commandline stuff, so why not fool around with some Java CLI libraries?

Of course we need some kind of service, so I decided to use the list of todos of the great [jsonplaceholder](http://placeholder.typicode.com). All this stuff is coded in the ``jsonplaceholder`` library.

Next there is ``jsonplaceholder-springshell`` using [Spring Shell](https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/) for creating the actual CLI. So far, it's quite tedious, but I need some more experimentation.

Up on the todo list is checking out [picocli](https://picocli.info/) - to be continued :)
